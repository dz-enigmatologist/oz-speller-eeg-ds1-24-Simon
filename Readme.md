This repo contains the DSI-24 files data columns same as DSI-7
https://github.com/NeuroTech-UCSD/Oz-Speller/tree/main/data/eeg_recordings/32-class_speller/DSI-24/Simon/

Extract dsi 24 data from oz speller, remove some of the columns so that it looks the same as dsi 7 data 
(make sure that the electrodes are the same). So that we can use this as sample data for training the model.
